**Biography:**
Christian H. Cooper is an independent researcher specializing in the application of Artificial Intelligence for the preservation and revitalization of low-resource Indigenous languages. Inspired by historical linguistic records and the pressing need for scalable, community-driven language tools, he developed a "Community-in-the-Loop" framework combining AI fine-tuning (LoRA) with narrative cultural correction. This approach was successfully prototyped for the Stoney Nakoda language in Alberta, Canada, creating a functional conversational AI model improved directly by community feedback. His work explores the ethical integration of technology like LLMs to support cultural sovereignty and knowledge transmission, aiming to provide adaptable tools for Indigenous communities worldwide. He actively seeks collaboration with communities interested in applying these methods. *(Approx. 135 words)*

**Title of Session:**
Digital Canoes: Paddling Together with AI for Lingít Language Revitalization

**Abstract of Presentation:**
Southeast Alaskan Indigenous languages, like Lingít, hold irreplaceable cultural knowledge but face revitalization challenges requiring innovative, scalable tools. This presentation introduces an adaptable AI framework, successfully prototyped for Stoney Nakoda, designed for exactly this purpose. We propose a "Community-in-the-Loop" model distillation process where a base AI language model is iteratively refined through *narrative correction* provided by Lingít speakers and knowledge keepers. Instead of simple right/wrong feedback, this method prioritizes the rich cultural context, stories, and nuances embedded in the language. Using parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (LoRA), the AI learns not just vocabulary and grammar, but culturally appropriate usage and understanding. The session will demonstrate the core concepts, showcase the project pipeline (data prep, model training, community feedback integration), and explore its potential as a dynamic, living language resource controlled and shaped *by* the Lingít community. We will discuss how this approach aligns with culturally responsive education principles, fosters collaboration, and offers a powerful, respectful technological partner in language revitalization efforts. Participants will engage with the concepts through discussion and a conceptual demonstration. *(Approx. 220 words)*

**Preferred format. You may select more than one:**
*   In-Person Presentation
*   Workshop (Implied by interactive elements)
*   Panel Discussion (If applicable, less likely as primary presenter)
*   Virtual Presentation (If required/possible)

**Are you willing to present your session more than once?**
Yes

**Preferred presentation date:**
*   August 6th
*   August 7th
*   August 8th
*(Select all available)*

**Preferred Session Length:**
*   75 Minutes Presentation (allowing 15 min Q&A/Discussion within 90 min block)

**Technical Requirements/Equipment:**
*   Projector & Screen
*   Microphone (depending on room size)
*   Sound system (if audio examples are used)
*   Reliable Internet Connection (for potential live demo elements)

**If you have any comments to add to your choices for session length, repeating a session, or repeating a session virtually please leave them here:**
The 75-minute format allows sufficient time for presenting the framework, demonstrating key concepts, and facilitating meaningful interaction and discussion with participants. Happy to repeat the session to accommodate more attendees.

**How does your presentation align with the conference theme?**
This presentation directly embodies the theme "Strengthen in Unity: Innovating Together for Culturally Responsive Education." The "Community-in-the-Loop" AI framework is inherently collaborative, placing Lingít speakers at the center of technological development. It offers an innovative tool to help the language "thrive in spaces of belonging," particularly education, by creating a dynamic, culturally attuned resource. It directly addresses the integration of Indigenous knowledge (narrative correction) with scientific methods (AI fine-tuning) to sustain cultural vitality for future generations, aligning perfectly with SHI's vision.

**Which conference strand do you feel best fits your presentation?**
While touching on several strands, it best fits:
*   **Develop and publish educational curricula, materials, and scholarly studies of Native arts, cultures, languages, and history** (The AI model *becomes* a dynamic material)
*   **Create high-quality language resources and incorporate those into schools and community activities** (This is the primary output and goal)
*   **Develop scientific research and educational programs that integrate Indigenous and scientific knowledge...** (The methodology is this integration)

*(Select the most primary one in the actual form, likely "Create high-quality language resources...")*

**Why do you think your topic is important to current discussions in the field?**
Language revitalization urgently needs scalable, adaptable, and culturally sensitive tools. Traditional methods, while vital, often face resource limitations. This presentation introduces a cutting-edge approach using AI not as a replacement, but as a powerful *amplifier* for community efforts. It moves beyond simple digital dictionaries to create conversational AI that can learn nuance, context, and cultural appropriateness, directly addressing critiques of generic AI lacking cultural grounding. This work is at the forefront of discussions on ethical AI, Indigenous data sovereignty, and culturally responsive technology integration.

**Describe your level of experience as a presenter, have you presented at our CRE conferences in the past? Other conferences? Have you presented on this topic before?**
I have experience presenting technical concepts to diverse audiences at technology meetups and academic settings. While I have not presented at SHI's CRE conference before, I have shared the foundational Stoney Nakoda project work in smaller forums and online. This specific adaptation proposal for Lingít is new, building directly upon that proven methodology. I am comfortable explaining complex AI ideas in accessible ways and facilitating engaging discussions.

*   Link to the Stoney Language Model App (as demo): *(Provide Hugging Face Space link from README)*
*   *(Add links to any blog posts, papers, or recorded talks if available)*

**Do you have any conflicts of interest to disclose related to your presentation?**
No

**Describe the experiences you have had that have led to your interest in the topics that will be explored at this conference.**
My interest stems from encountering historical records, like George Mercer Dawson's maps, that highlighted both the richness of Indigenous languages and their frequent marginalization in colonial documentation. Seeing artifacts like James Hector's sketch humanized this history. This sparked a desire to apply modern AI not just theoretically, but practically, to help preserve these vital cultural treasures. The development of the Stoney Nakoda project confirmed the potential of community-AI partnership, motivating me to explore how this successful framework could respectfully serve other communities, like those in Southeast Alaska, facing similar challenges.

**Please indicate the participant objective(s) for your session. List a minimum of 3 outcomes.**
Participants will be able to:
1.  Understand the "Community-in-the-Loop" AI framework and its potential for low-resource language revitalization (e.g., Lingít).
2.  Analyze the significance of *narrative correction* versus simple accuracy feedback in developing culturally responsive AI language tools.
3.  Evaluate how parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) enables community-driven adaptation of AI models.
4.  Identify potential pathways and challenges for implementing such a collaborative AI project within their own Southeast Alaskan contexts.

**Please describe how will your presentation be engaging for participants? What elements beyond lecturing have you included?**
Beyond a clear explanation of the framework, engagement will be fostered through:
1.  **Visual Storytelling:** Using diagrams and real-world examples from the Stoney Nakoda project (like the Nomic map concept) to illustrate concepts.
2.  **Conceptual Demonstration:** Walking through the process, potentially showing simplified examples of AI responses and how narrative correction improves them.
3.  **Interactive Q&A:** Dedicated time for questions and deeper dives into technical or cultural aspects.
4.  **Think-Pair-Share:** A brief activity asking participants to brainstorm potential applications or challenges of this AI approach within the Lingít context (or their own language).
5.  **Open Invitation:** Encouraging attendees to connect afterwards to discuss potential collaborations for their specific language needs.

**Are you presenting as part of a SHI program?**
No

**For what type of audience is your session intended? (check all that apply)**
*   Educators (K-12)
*   Educators (Post-Secondary)
*   School District/University Administration/Staff
*   Researchers
*   Elders
*   Community Members / Language & Culture Advocates
*   Students (High School)
*   Students (Undergraduate & Graduate)
*   Tribal Leaders / Policymakers

**Does your presentation lend itself to a half-day field experience/cultural activity? If so, please outline the event and describe the activities and objectives.**
No, the core of this presentation is focused on the technological framework and collaborative methodology. A field experience doesn't directly align.

**SHI covers cost of travel and books all CRE-related travel arrangements. Will you need to and from travel to the conference?**
Yes *(Assuming travel from outside Juneau)*

**How do you plan to make your presentation accessible to a diverse audience?**
Accessibility will be addressed by:
1.  Using clear, jargon-minimized language when explaining technical AI concepts.
2.  Employing strong visual aids (diagrams, simplified code snippets only if essential, examples).
3.  Providing context for the AI techniques and focusing on the *process and collaboration* rather than deep algorithms.
4.  Explicitly inviting questions throughout and during the Q&A to ensure understanding across different backgrounds.
5.  Making presentation slides available afterwards (potentially including links to the underlying project).

**Do you have any other information to share regarding your participation?**
I am deeply impressed by SHI's work and the vision of this conference. I believe this community-centered AI approach offers a genuinely new and potentially transformative tool for language revitalization efforts in Southeast Alaska. I am eager to share this framework, learn from conference participants, and explore possibilities for respectful and effective collaboration with interested Lingít (or other SE Alaskan language) speakers and communities.
