Okay, here are over 50 inferred rules regarding Shmalgyack grammar, word order, spelling, and morphology based *only* on the provided context. These are hypotheses derived from patterns in the limited data and would need further validation with a larger corpus or native speaker input.

**I. Spelling and Phonology Rules**

1.  **Apostrophe Usage:** The apostrophe (`'`) is a common and significant part of Shmalgyack spelling, appearing frequently within words (e.g., `gya'wn`, `hla'at`, `hlgu'yoota`). It likely represents a specific phoneme (like a glottal stop) or affects pronunciation/syllabification.
2.  **Apostrophe Placement:** Apostrophes often precede consonants such as `d`, `k`, `t`, `ts`, `w`, `y`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `b`, `g` (e.g., `'dsm`, `'koy`, `'wee`, `'yoota`, `hla'ashg`, `lu'kwil`).
3.  **Double Consonants:** Double consonants, particularly `gg`, are permissible and appear common (e.g., `ggaagg`, `ggoab`, `ggaldsap`, `gganaow`).
4.  **Double Vowels:** Double vowels, notably `aa`, `ee`, occur (e.g., `aam`, `aadsika`, `geegsh`, `leemeet`, `needsu`).
5.  **Common Consonant Clusters:** Certain consonant clusters appear frequently: `hl` (`hla`, `hlgu`), `ck` (`ckshoa`, `ckbaala`), `ksh` (`kshagyoatguu`, `ckshoa`), `shg` (`shga`, `shgyent`), `ds` (`dsaba`, `dsoackt`), `ts` (`'tsamaatga`), `tk` (`dackshmhietksha`), `gw` (`gwee`, `gwai'hl`), `kw` (`lu'kwil`, `kwdeeyu`).
6.  **Absence of Certain English Letters:** Letters like Q, X, V seem absent or rare in the provided examples (except for names like `Everett`, `Viet Nam`).
7.  **Word Endings:** Words frequently end in vowels (`a`, `u`, `i`, `o`, `e`), or consonants like `k`, `t/d`, `sh`, `m`, `n`, `g`, `l` (e.g., `hoan`, `waab`, `hlagu`, `gyad`, `dm`, `hla`, `ggan`, `ckshoa`, `gya'wn`).
8.  **Use of 'h':** The letter 'h' is common, appearing initially (`hla`, `hoan`), medially (`aadmhoant`), and in clusters (`sh`, `hl`, `ckh`).
9.  **Case Sensitivity:** Proper nouns (names of people like `Dzon`, `Silas`, `Maata`; places like `Macklackaahla`, `Gitsgaan`) seem to retain capitalization, suggesting case is significant for names. Common nouns are generally lowercase.
10. **Lack of Silent Letters (Inferred):** The orthography seems relatively phonetic, with most written letters likely contributing to the sound (educated guess).

**II. Word Order Rules**

11. **Verb Position:** Verbs often appear early in the clause, suggesting a potential Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) or Verb-Object-Subject (VOS) tendency (e.g., `Geegsh Dzon shu aad...` / Bought John new net...).
12. **Subject Pronoun Incorporation:** Subject pronouns (like "I") might be incorporated into the verb form in some cases (e.g., `Needsu` = I see/saw, `-nu` suffix potentially marks "I").
13. **Adjective Placement:** Adjectives generally seem to precede the nouns they modify (e.g., `shu aad` / new net, `'wee ggan` / big wood, `hlgu hash` / little dog).
14. **Possessive Pronoun Placement:** Possessive pronouns (`yagwa` / my, `awaa` / your) precede the noun they modify (e.g., `yagwa goom` / my father, `awaa waabn` / your house).
15. **Negator Placement:** The negator `Ahlgadee` typically comes before the word or phrase it negates (often a verb or `aam` 'good').
16. **Preposition Placement:** Words functioning like prepositions (`da`, `lack`) usually precede the noun phrase they govern (e.g., `da waab` / by the house, `lack geeka` / on the beach).
17. **Clause Structure:** `Hla` and `wil` can introduce subordinate clauses, often translating to 'when'.
18. **Question Word Order:** Interrogative words (`Ndahl`, `Naahl`, `Goahl`) typically begin a question sentence.
19. **`Gwee` Placement:** The demonstrative(?) `gwee` ('that') often appears after the noun it refers to (e.g., `'yoota gwee` / that man).

**III. Morphology: Prefixes**

20. **`hlgu-` Diminutive Prefix:** `hlgu-` likely marks a diminutive ('little', 'young') (e.g., `hlgu hash` / little dog, `hlgu 'yoota` / boy).
21. **`aam-` Prefix:** Appears in words related to 'good' or quality (`aam` / good, `aamndapa` / right length, `aamshgaboo` / enough), but also as 'I'm'. Might indicate state/quality.
22. **`ha'li-` Locative/Object Prefix:** `ha'li-` appears in words for places or objects used in specific locations (`ha'li'daa` / chair, `ha'li'dameesh` / table, `ha'linoak` / bed, `ha'ligalmeelg` / playground), suggesting 'place of/for X'.
23. **`gga-` Prefix:** Appears in many words, possibly related to actions, states, or objects (`ggatgyada` / strong, `ggaagg` / raven, `ggaboackm` / gather cockles). Function needs more data.
24. **`ck-` / `k-` Prefixes:** Very common initial sounds, may form part of roots or have grammatical function (`ckshoa` / canoe, `kwdeeyu` / hungry).
25. **`aads-` / `ads-` Prefixes:** Seen in `aadsika` (straight), `aadsacka` (long), `adsiksha` (proud). Might relate to stative verbs or adjectives.
26. **`ama-` Prefix:** Seen in `ama` (good/really), `ama'basha` (beautiful), `amaneedsin` (be careful). Potential marker for quality or state.

**IV. Morphology: Suffixes**

27. **`-nu` First-Person Suffix:** `-nu` appears frequently on verbs where the English translation is first-person singular ("I") (e.g., `yaawckga'nu` / I will eat, `baasha'nu` / I'm afraid).
28. **`-ga` Verbal Suffix:** `-ga` occurs often on words functioning as verbs (`kshwa'dackga` / whistled, `hultga` / full, `dalbikshga` / shrink). Might indicate tense, aspect, or be part of the verb root.
29. **`-t`/`-d`/`-k` Noun/Verb Endings:** These suffixes appear on various nouns and verbs, potentially indicating completed action, state, agency, or nominalization (e.g., `hlaagigyad` / people, `gyad` / people, `ckaldaawckga` / medicine, `algyackd` / speaks, `meelgd` / dancing, `cksh'waanck` / herring eggs).
30. **`-m` / `-n` Suffixes:** Appear on nouns and verbs, possibly indicating possession, nominalization, or specific grammatical forms (`hoanm` / fish, `ggaldsapm` / our village?, `gya'wn` / today/now, `waabn` / your house?, `amookshn` / listen, `bilaan` / belt).
31. **`-sh` Suffix:** Common suffix, appearing on nouns (`adaawck` / stories needs correction?, no - `adaawck` has -ck), verbs (`geegsh` / bought, `dawhlsh` / leave for), potentially place names (`klushmsh` / Nass River). Function is diverse.
32. **`-u` / `-yu` Possessive Suffix?:** May indicate 'my' in some contexts when `yagwa` isn't used (`noayu` / my mom, `nabeebu` / my uncle, `anaashu` / my skin, `ggoadu` / my heart). (Hypothesis).
33. **`-a` Ending:** Very common word ending, possibly a default vowel or grammatical marker.
34. **`-hl` / `-al` Suffix/Cluster:** Occurs in words like `adaahl` (fire), `ckaldaawckga` (medicine), possibly functional or part of root.
35. **`-ck` / `-k` Ending:** Common ending (`adaawck` / stories, `gyalck` / outside, `hackdek` / tool).
36. **`-ee` Ending:** Common suffix (`melee`, `haleemee`), maybe part of root or grammatical.

**V. Grammar and Function Words**

37. **`Dm` Future/Intent Marker:** `Dm` consistently appears with future actions or intentions ("will", "going to").
38. **`Ahlgadee` Negator:** `Ahlgadee` (and variations like `ahlga`, `ahlgandee`) functions as 'not', 'don't', 'doesn't', 'haven't', 'never'.
39. **`Hla` Determiner/Conjunction:** `Hla` may function like 'the', 'when', 'that', or mark state 'is/are'. Needs context.
40. **`Da` Preposition/Determiner:** `Da` appears extremely versatile, likely covering functions of 'the', 'in', 'on', 'at', 'by', 'to', 'of'.
41. **`Wil` Question/Location/Condition:** `Wil` appears in questions (`Ndahl wil...?`), and possibly marks location ('where') or condition ('when').
42. **`Gyad` Noun 'People':** `gyad` consistently refers to 'people'.
43. **`Gwee` Demonstrative:** `gwee` often translates to 'that' or refers to something previously mentioned or pointed out.
44. **`Lack` Determiner/Locative:** `lack` precedes nouns, possibly meaning 'the' or indicating 'the place of' (e.g., `lack shuulda` / the ocean).
45. **`Nee` Verb 'See'/'Look' / Conjunction?:** `Nee` translates to 'see/saw/look' but also appears in constructions like `'nee gun` / 'that's why'.
46. **`Ada` Conjunction 'And':** `Ada` seems to function as 'and'.
47. **Interrogative Words:** `Ndahl` (Where/When?), `Naahl` (Who?), `Goahl` (What/Why?) introduce questions.
48. **Absence of Copula (sometimes):** English sentences with "is/are/was/were" sometimes translate to Shmalgyack without an explicit verb 'to be' (e.g., `Aadsacka hagwilhoo` / The rope is long enough). `Hla` might sometimes serve this role.
49. **Possession Marking:** Possession is marked either by preceding pronouns (`yagwa`, `awaa`) or possibly suffixes (`-u`, `-n`).
50. **Compounding?**: Some concepts seem expressed by juxtaposing words (`shameeym wun` / deer meat, `waabm hash` / dog house, `cksh'waanck` / herring eggs), suggesting noun compounding might occur.
51. **Repetition for Intensity?**: The repetition in `Lack dee awaan wil wun wun` / `The deer can be found on the hill there` *might* imply something more than simple mention, but this is highly speculative with one example.
52. **Command Form:** `Giloa` is used for negative commands ("Don't..."). Affirmative commands might be the base verb form (e.g., `Shguu` / Put).
53. **Particles (`Sha`, `Ga`, `Ap`):** Short words like `sha`, `ga`, `ap` appear frequently with variable translations, possibly acting as particles marking tense, focus, or connection.
